# Join us! 

We are Bitspossessed, a software developers collective. We support people, organizations, and communities to realize technologically-driven ideas.

Bitspossessed provides a healthy, supportive space for our members to build software cooperatively. We strive to contribute to a more just and equitable tech industry, a sustainable digital commons, and an ecologically-regenerative future that prioritizes care and social responsibility.
