        <h2>The Circles Project</h2>
        <p>
          We are the maintainers of Circles UBI, a protocol and open source project running a basic income on the Ethereum blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we launched the project last year, Circles has become a wider network of collectives and initiatives building alternative economic systems for their local neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial work has mostly been carried by the Bitspossessed developer collective and the Circles Cooperative in Berlin. With Circles growing beyond its MVP status we are looking now for more developers to bring the stack to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in more information about Circles and its philosophy, you can read our official <a href="https://joincircles.net/faq">FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://handbook.joincircles.net/docs/developers/whitepaper/">whitepaper</a>.

            <p><a href=https://www.circles.garden> circles.garden </a>is one of the web-applications built on top of it.  The backend system architecture is composed by multiple intermediate services to interact with the Blockchain layer to overcome different limitations. For instance, Circles uses a meta-transaction relayer service, which pays the gas fees for the users.</p>
            <p> This and the ever-growing <a href="https://handbook.joincircles.net/docs/developers/transitive-transactions/transfer-limitations-in-practice">trust network for transitive transfers</a> - which is unique for Circles - create interesting and challenging design problems for the backend infrastructure.</p>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are looking for someone who:</p>
