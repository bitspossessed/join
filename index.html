        <h2>The Circles Project</h2>
        <p>
          We are the maintainers of Circles UBI, a protocol and open source project running a basic income on the Ethereum blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we launched the project last year, Circles has become a wider network of collectives and initiatives building alternative economic systems for their local neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial work has mostly been carried by the Bitspossessed developer collective and the Circles Cooperative in Berlin. With Circles growing beyond its MVP status we are looking now for more developers to bring the stack to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in more information about Circles and its philosophy, you can read our official <a href="https://joincircles.net/faq">FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://handbook.joincircles.net/docs/developers/whitepaper/">whitepaper</a>.

          <summary>
            <p>
              Since Circles consists of various decentralized organizations, we as Bitspossessed have to coordinate internally but also with our allies and the Open Source community: What are the needs? What is the next step in the roadmap? What can we realize? This work has shown itself to be very diverse as it entails bridging UX & Design ideas, political decisions, technical design problems and coordination of our own developer team.

              We are looking for someone who:

            </li>
            <li>
              Coordinates and participates in meetings with different stakeholders, initiatives and individuals to find out what they need technically to be realized
            </li>
            <li>
              Informs the development team about decisions

              The Circles is a relatively experimental stack aiming at a low-barrier entrance level for users who are not familiar with typical Dapp patterns. This requirement has led us to a more "Burner style" wallet to avoid users having to interact with solutions like MetaMask. Therefore a meta-transaction relayer service is used, which pays the gas fees for the users. This and the ever-growing <a href="https://handbook.joincircles.net/docs/developers/whitepaper">trust network for transitive transfers</a> - which is unique for Circles - create interesting and challenging design problems.

            <li>
              Loves thinking and learning about transitive transfers, meta transactions, distributed off-chain data storage, privacy, social recovery and new Circles concepts like group currencies
            </li>
            <li>
              Has experience in developing complex systems in JavaScript/TypeScript, NodeJS and Web3 throughout the whole stack, from Express to React and back

            <li>
              Leads technical decisions and system architecture

              Circles has been growing very fast and while we migrated to Kubernetes on Digital Ocean and solved most bottlenecks and scaling issues inside the code bases, we still lack knowledge and confidence in running our servers and infrastructure reliably.
